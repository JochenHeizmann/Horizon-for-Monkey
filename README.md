# Horizon for Monkey

This is a port and lite version of my [BlitzMax-Prototyping-Framework Horizon][] for [Monkey][].

## Installation

1. Check out into the modules folder of monkey (C:\Program Files\Monkey\modules on Windows, /Applications/Monkey/modules on OS X)

        $ git clone git@github.com:JochenHeizmann/Horizon-for-Monkey.git "./horizon"

2. It is now available from within Monkey.

## Examples

Will follow ;)

## Dependencies

At the moment, the payment module is just a wrapper for the great IAP-Module by Anawiki. So you need the [IAP-Module][] if you want to do iOS-In-App-Purchases. Support for Android will follow soon.
